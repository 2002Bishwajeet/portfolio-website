## ü§ñ Tech Stack

**This website is built with:**

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a CSS library to rapidly design components using HTML classes.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a JS library to build reactive frontend. Alongside this, application uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a static site hosting with amazing deployment flow using Git

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/https://github.com/2002Bishwajeet/2002bishwajeet-portfolio)

### Add your data

- Add your profile picture with name `profile.png` in assets folder.

* For logo, I made one using Adobe Photoshop, if you want to use your own logo, you can add it with name `logo-dark.png` in assets folder. Or just remove this from the `src/lib/Header.svelte` file.

- Same goes for `favicon.ico`. Replace it in the `public` folder.

 Rename `biswa.json` with username of your choice

Replace with the `json` below with appropriate date
Make sure you remove these comments when adding in `json` Files.
Or rename it with `.jsonc` - Its `json` with comments.

For Icons, I have used [iconify](https://iconify.design/). For icons data
refer to the [icon-sets.iconify.design](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) and use that if in `icon` field.

```jsonc

    }
  ]
}
```

That's it. Goto `src/App.svelte` and check if your json file has been imported properly.

**And it should worküéâ.**

# üìö Svelte + TS + Vite (Generated)

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- It brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- It is first and foremost a framework that just happens to use Vite under the hood, not a Vite app.
  `vite dev` and `vite build` wouldn't work in a SvelteKit environment, for example.

This template contains as little as possible to get started with Vite + TypeScript + Svelte, while taking into account the developer experience with regards to HMR and intellisense. It demonstrates capabilities on par with the other `create-vite` templates and is a good starting point for beginners dipping their toes into a Vite + Svelte project.

Should you later need the extended capabilities and extensibility provided by SvelteKit, the template has been structured similarly to SvelteKit so that it is easy to migrate.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `allowJs` in the TS template?**

While `allowJs: false` would indeed prevent the use of `.js` files in the project, it does not prevent the use of JavaScript syntax in `.svelte` files. In addition, it would force `checkJs: false`, bringing the worst of both worlds: not being able to guarantee the entire codebase is TypeScript, and also having worse typechecking for the existing JavaScript. In addition, there are valid use cases in which a mixed codebase may be relevant.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-hmr#svelte-hmr).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```ts
// store.ts
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'
export default writable(0)
```
